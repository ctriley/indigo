We report the development of a method to parameterize and predict the performance of structurally flexible β-turn-containing peptide catalysts, using the atroposelective bromination of 3-arylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones as a case study. The multivariate correlations obtained for tetrapeptides of two β-turn types, type I′ pre-helical and type II′ β-hairpin, indicate that although one conformer may be associated with a more dominant contribution to the observed enantioselectivity, it is possible that multiple conformers contribute to a complex transition state ensemble.
