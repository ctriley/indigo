Diarylmethylamido bis(phenols) have been subjected to peptide-catalyzed, enantioselective bromination reactions. Desymmetrization of compounds in this class has been achieved such that enantioenriched products may be isolated with up to 97:3 er. Mechanistically, the observed enantioselectivity was shown to be primarily a function of differential functionalization of enantiotopic arenes, although additional studies unveiled a contribution from secondary kinetic resolution of the product (to afford the symmetrical dibromide) under the reaction conditions. Variants of the tetrapeptide catalyst were also evaluated and revealed a striking observationâ€”enantiodivergent catalysis is observed upon changing the achiral amino acid residue in the catalyst (at the i+2 position) from an aminocyclopropane carboxamide residue (97:3 er) to an aminoisobutyramide residue (33:67 er) under a common set of conditions. An expanded set of catalysts was also evaluated, enabling structure/selectivity correlations to be considered in a mechanistic light.
